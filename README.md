# Space-Exploration
A Sandbox Game powered by Python and Ursina Engine


# History
It all started back when I was 11 and I want to make a space game where you can explore and build as free as it could be. 2 years later, I started making the game with the Ursina Engine when Panda3d Engine version Failed. I hope you like it. You can support my work by giving ideas and fixing bugs. The game will be free, but you need to check out the license.
