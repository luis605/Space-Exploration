# Space-Exploration
A Sandbox Game powered by Python and Ursina Engine

![Alt text](https://lusluistomascabetede.npkn.net/site-status-badge/)

# History
It all started back when I was 11 and I wanted to make a space game where I could explore and build as free as it could be. 2 years later, I started making the game prototype with Ursina Engine, when the Panda3d Engine version failed. I hope you like it. You can support my work by giving ideas and fixing bugs. The game will be free, but you need to check out the license.

# Build and Run
First of all you will need to have python and pypi installed on your machine www.python.org/download .

Next install panda3d, ursina and perlin_noise with pypi:

`pip install [package]`
or
`pip3 install [package]`
or by running
`pip3 install -r "requirements.txt` in build folder

After that you can `run` main.py!!!

# Info
Every month I will update the game.
